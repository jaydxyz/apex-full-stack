## Basic Structure of an HTML5 Document

Here's a simple example of the basic structure of an HTML5 document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My First HTML5 Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
    </header>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
            <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
            <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    <main>
        <article>
            <h2>About HTML5</h2>
            <p>HTML5 is the latest version of HTML, used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.</p>
